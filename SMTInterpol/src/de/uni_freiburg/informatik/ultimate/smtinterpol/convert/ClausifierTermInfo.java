/**
 * A helper class to remember conversion information about all subterms and subformulas of the asserted formulas. It
 * stores for every subterm or a subformula has been converted before what its conversion is.
 *
 * For a subformula (a subterm of type Bool), we remember the auxiliary literal used for CNF conversion. For a subterm
 * we remember its CCTerm (node in the equivalence graph) if it was created, or a LASharedTerm if it lives in the theory
 * of linear arithmetic.
 *
 * There are also flags that indicate for a subformula, whether the formula was asserted positively or negatively, and
 * whether the auxiliary axioms for the positive or negative literals were added. For a subterm there are flags that
 * indicate for a subterm and whether its auxiliary axioms were added, whether it has a CCTerm or lives in linear
 * arithmetic. However, these flags are not stored in this class, but in another ScopedHashMap in Clausifier. The reason
 * is that we need to remember for each scope what the flags were at this scope.
