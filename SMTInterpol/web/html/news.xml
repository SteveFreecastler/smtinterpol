    <txt> We participated in the <link url="https://smt-comp.github.io/2021/">SMT-COMP 2021</link>.
    In the single-query track we won the division "Quantifier-free Equality with Linear Arithmetic".
    In the incremental track we won "Quantifier-free Nonlinear Integer Arithmetic" and "Quantifier-free Equality with Nonlinear Arithmetic". 
    We scored the second place in the biggest lead ranking for the incremental track.

    <txt>We participated in the <link url="https://smt-comp.github.io/2018/">SMTCOMP 2018</link> which was part of the <link url="https://www.floc2018.org/">FLoC</link> Olympic Games in Oxford.
    <s /> won the unsat core track for quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic and real arithmetic (QF_LIA and QF_LRA) and made it to the third place in the overall evaluation.

    <head1>Interpolation for Arrays</head1>
    <txt><s /> now supports interpolation in the quantifier-free logic of arrays.
    </txt>

    <head1>New release 2.5</head1>
    <txt>We released version 2.5 of <s />.
    This release has full support for the quantifier-free fragment for
    arrays.  Although this theory have been supported in the solver for a
    while, the new release also supports generation of interpolants for
    this theory.
    We also updated the parser to support SMTLIB version 2.5.

    <head1><s /> at SMTCOMP 2014</head1>
    <txt>We participated in the <link url="https://smt-comp.github.io/2014/">SMTCOMP 2014</link> which was part of the Vienna Summer of Logic Olympic Games.
    The primary new feature was our array solver which performed really good.  We were awarded with the  G&ouml;del medal for the second place according to the multi-division error-free scoring.  Furthermore, David Cok - the lead organizer of the competition - awarded us with a beautiful "big A" also known as a universal quantifier when put in correct position.  We thank all the supporters that helped to improve <s /> and, of course, the organizers of the competition and the VSL olympic games for these nice awards.<nl /><img src="floc2014.jpg" alt="Awards for SMTInterpol during VSL 2014" /><img src="goedel.jpg" alt="The goedel medal" /></txt>

<txt>The scoring system that was applied this year penalized errors in a draconic way.  This quasi led to the disqualification of the main competitors CVC4 and Yices.  Also Z3 and MathSAT were not competing this year.  Therefore the second place should be taken with a grain of salt.</txt>

    <head1>New preview release</head1>
    <txt>A preview to release 2.2 of <s /> is available.  This release contains a new array decision procedure which is designed to enable quantifier-free interpolation.  The interpolation procedure however is not yet implemented.  Additionally we changed the model generation such that we now produce anonymous terms of the form (as @0 S) for a sort S.  The array model basically are a difference map to an array (as @0 (Array TI TE)) that contains at every index the value (as @0 TE).  Note that in the current version of our array solver the index type Bool is not supported.</txt>

    <head1>New minor release</head1>
    <txt>Release 2.1 of <s /> is available.  Among some bug fixes this release includes support for user cancellation requests.  While <s /> is performing a satisfiability check it now regularly polls a cancellation request that can be configured via the API.</txt>
    <head1>New release</head1>
    <txt>A new release is available.  This release fixes a bug in the tree interpolation engine and provides SMTLIB 2 compliant models for IRA logics.</txt>
    <head1>New bugfix release</head1>
    <txt>A new release of <s /> is available. It now allows users to define functions that take arguments in QF_LIA and QF_LRA. Thanks to Hans-Martin Adorf for reporting this bug.</txt>
    <head1>SMT Competition 2012</head1>
    <txt><s /> participates in the <link
    url="https://smt-comp.github.io/2012/">SMT-COMP 2012</link>
    in the main, application, unsat-core, and in the demonstration track.
    A slightly newer version of <s /> is available from the download
    page.</txt>
    
    <head1>Proof Transformations</head1>
    <txt>The latest version of <s /> incorporates the proof tree transformation techniques presented by Fontaine et. al. in their paper <link url="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22438-6_19">Compression of Propositional Resolution Proofs via Partial Regularization"</link>.  The option <tt>:proof-transformation</tt> can be used to activate one of the algorithms presented in this paper.  Possible values are:

    <head1>License Change</head1>
    <txt>On popular demand we changed the license of <s /> from
    GPL to LGPL.</txt> <head1>SMT Competition 2011</head1> <txt>A pre-release
    version of <s /> 2.0 participated in the <link
    url="http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net/2011/">SMT-COMP 2011</link> in the main and in the application track.
    See these pages for further details. This was the first time <s />
    participated in the competition. It showed its strength in the divisions
    QF_UFLRA and QF_UFLIA where it could solve as many instances as the winner
    of this division in the main track.</txt>
